# 🏥 LLM and RAG-Powered Medical Chatbot

An advanced RASA-based medical chatbot with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** capabilities, providing intelligent symptom assessment, medication guidance, mental health support, and chronic disease management with **source attribution and safety validation**.

## 🚀 New RAG Features

### ✅ **Enhanced Capabilities**
- **Intelligent Query Routing**: Automatically classifies queries and routes to appropriate retrieval strategies
- **Vector-Based Retrieval**: Semantic search through medical knowledge with relevance scoring
- **Emergency Detection**: Immediate identification and response to medical emergencies
- **Source Attribution**: Every response includes verifiable medical sources with confidence scores
- **Multi-Layer Safety Validation**: Advanced safety checking with medical disclaimer injection
- **Confidence Scoring**: Quantified trust levels for all medical information provided

### 🎯 **RAG Solves Key LLM Limitations**
- ✅ **Eliminates Hallucinations**: Grounds responses in verified medical sources
- ✅ **Up-to-Date Information**: Dynamic retrieval from latest medical databases  
- ✅ **Traceability**: Every response references its source (CDC, DrugBank, internal KB)
- ✅ **Customization**: Blend general medical knowledge with proprietary guidelines

## 🔧 **Quick Setup**

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set up Pinecone API Key
```bash
export PINECONE_API_KEY="your-pinecone-api-key-here"
```

### 3. Initialize RAG System
```bash
python setup_rag.py
```

### 4. Test RAG Components
```bash
python test_rag_system.py
```

### 5. Start the Chatbot
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start RASA Action Server
rasa run actions

# Terminal 2: Start Chatbot Interface  
rasa shell
```

## 📋 **Key Workflows**

### 1. **Intelligent Query Classification**
```python
# Example: Drug interaction query
User: "Can I take ibuprofen with alcohol?"
→ Classified as: DRUG_INTERACTION
→ Retrieval Strategy: interaction_focused
→ Sources: DrugBank, internal_kb
→ Safety Level: HIGH_PRIORITY
```

### 2. **Emergency Detection & Response**
```python
# Example: Emergency situation
User: "I'm having severe chest pain"
→ Emergency Flag: TRUE
→ Immediate Response: Emergency protocol
→ Action: Direct to emergency services
→ No LLM processing delay
```

### 3. **Source-Attributed Responses**
```python
# Example: Symptom inquiry
User: "What causes persistent headaches?"
→ Vector Retrieval: symptom_focused
→ Sources: [internal_kb (0.9), MedlinePlus (0.8)]
→ Confidence: 0.85
→ Response: Detailed answer + source citations
```

### 4. **Multi-Layer Safety Validation**
```python
# Example: Safety check pipeline
LLM Response → Content Analysis → Medical Disclaimer → Source Verification → Final Output
```

## 🧪 **Testing & Validation**

### **Comprehensive Test Suite**
- ✅ Query classification accuracy

## 🎯 **Example Interactions**

### **Drug Interaction Query**
```
User: "Can I take ibuprofen with my blood pressure medication?"

Bot: Based on medical sources, combining ibuprofen with blood pressure medications can reduce their effectiveness and may increase blood pressure. This is because NSAIDs like ibuprofen can interfere with ACE inhibitors and other BP medications.

⚠️ **Important**: Always consult your pharmacist or doctor before combining medications.

📚 **Sources**: DrugBank (confidence: 0.9), internal_kb (confidence: 0.9)
✅ **High confidence response** (0.89) - Information is well-sourced and reliable.
```

### **Emergency Detection**  
```
User: "I'm having severe chest pain and shortness of breath"

Bot: 🚨 **MEDICAL EMERGENCY** 🚨

If you're experiencing a medical emergency, please:
• Call emergency services immediately (911/999/112)  
• Go to the nearest emergency room
• Do not delay seeking professional medical help

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
• Call emergency services now (911/999/112)
• Do not delay seeking professional medical help  
• Follow emergency responder instructions
• Stay calm and seek immediate assistance
```
