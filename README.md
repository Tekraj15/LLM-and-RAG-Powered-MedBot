## LLM-and-RAG-Powered-MedBot

An advanced RASA-based medical chatbot with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** capabilities, providing intelligent symptom assessment, medication guidance, mental health support, and chronic disease management with **source attribution and safety validation**, supported by LLM  for handling ambiguous queries(out of the scope of the Knowledge Base) and generating dynamic responses, and RAG for solving the limitations of LLM.

## Data Sources for RAG
1. Structured Medical Knowledge
- DrugBank API: Medication interactions & side effects
- CDC Guidelines: Prevention & treatment protocols
- PubMed Abstracts: Latest research findings
- WHO Disease Guidelines: International standards

2. Unstructured Data Processing
- PDF Parsing and Extraction

3. Real-time API Integration with Medical Knowledge Bases
   
MEDICAL_APIS = {

    "drug_interactions": "https://api.drugbank.com/v1/interactions",
    
    "symptom_checker": "https://api.infermedica.com/v3/diagnosis",
    
    "clinical_guidelines": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/api/v2/studies"

## RAG Supported Architecture(WIP)

RAG is built with the following capabilities to solve the Key LLM limitations:

- ✅ **Eliminates Hallucinations**: Grounds responses in verified medical sources
- ✅ **Up-to-Date Information**: Dynamic retrieval from latest medical databases  
- ✅ **Traceability**: Every response references its source (CDC, DrugBank, internal KB)
- ✅ **Customization**: Blend general medical knowledge with proprietary guidelines

## Final Workflow:

## Key Workflows:

1. Precision First:
    Critical queries (e.g., drug interactions) are answered directly from the KB.

    Example:
    In `actions.py`:  
    if user_query == "aspirin and ibuprofen interaction":  
        return KB["aspirin"]["interactions"]["ibuprofen"]

2. RAG Retrieval Process
   
4. LLM Augmentation with RAG
    For complex or open-ended questions (e.g., "How to manage diabetes?"), LLM elaborates using KB data.

    Example prompt:
    "Based on [KB_Diabetes_Guide], list 3 diet tips for diabetes. Use simple language."  

3. Enhanced Validation Layer:
    Cross-check LLM outputs against the KB to filter out hallucinations.

## Example Workflows:

Case 1: Medication Interaction (Structured + RAG)

```python
# User: "Can I take aspirin with warfarin?"
# Step 1: Structured KB lookup
kb_result = MEDICAL_KB["interactions"].get(("aspirin", "warfarin"))

# Step 2: If not in KB, RAG retrieval
if not kb_result:
    context = retrieve_medical_context(
        "aspirin warfarin interaction", 
        {"medication": ["aspirin", "warfarin"]}
    )
    
# Step 3: LLM synthesis
response = generate_rag_response(
    "aspirin and warfarin interaction", 
    context
)

# Response: "According to DrugBank: Aspirin may increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, increasing bleeding risk. Sources: DrugBank 2024, PubMed Study 2023"
```

Case 2: Emerging Health Topic (RAG-Primary)

```python
# User: "Latest treatment for long COVID?"
# Step 1: RAG retrieval from latest sources
context = retrieve_medical_context(
    "long COVID treatment guidelines 2024",
    {"condition": "long COVID", "category": "treatment"}
)

# Step 2: LLM synthesis with recency filter
response = generate_rag_response(
    "current long COVID treatment protocols",
    filter_by_recency(context, max_days=180)  # Last 6 months
)

# Response: "According to WHO 2024 guidelines: Graduated exercise therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy show efficacy. Sources: WHO Guidelines 2024, NIH Bulletin 2025"
```

Case 3: Multi-faceted Query (Hybrid Approach)
```python
# User: "Diabetes management with kidney complications"
# Step 1: Structured KB for basics
kb_diabetes = MEDICAL_KB["chronic_conditions"]["diabetes"]["management"]
kb_kidney = MEDICAL_KB["complications"]["kidney"]

# Step 2: RAG for a specific combination
context = retrieve_medical_context(
    "diabetes nephropathy management",
    {"condition": ["diabetes", "kidney disease"]}
)

# Step 3: Combined response
response = combine_kb_and_rag(kb_diabetes, kb_kidney, context)
```

## 📋 **Key Workflows**

### 1. **Intelligent Query Classification**
```python
# Example: Drug interaction query
User: "Can I take ibuprofen with alcohol?"
→ Classified as: DRUG_INTERACTION
→ Retrieval Strategy: interaction_focused
→ Sources: DrugBank, internal_kb
→ Safety Level: HIGH_PRIORITY
```

### 2. **Emergency Detection & Response**
```python
# Example: Emergency situation
User: "I'm having severe chest pain"
→ Emergency Flag: TRUE
→ Immediate Response: Emergency protocol
→ Action: Direct to emergency services
→ No LLM processing delay
```

### 3. **Source-Attributed Responses**
```python
# Example: Symptom inquiry
User: "What causes persistent headaches?"
→ Vector Retrieval: symptom_focused
→ Sources: [internal_kb (0.9), MedlinePlus (0.8)]
→ Confidence: 0.85
→ Response: Detailed answer + source citations
```

### 4. **Multi-Layer Safety Validation**
```python
# Example: Safety check pipeline
LLM Response → Content Analysis → Medical Disclaimer → Source Verification → Final Output
```

## 🎯 **Example Interactions**

### **Drug Interaction Query**
```
User: "Can I take ibuprofen with my blood pressure medication?"

Bot: Based on medical sources, combining ibuprofen with blood pressure medications can reduce their effectiveness and may increase blood pressure. This is because NSAIDs like ibuprofen can interfere with ACE inhibitors and other BP medications.

⚠️ **Important**: Always consult your pharmacist or doctor before combining medications.

📚 **Sources**: DrugBank (confidence: 0.9), internal_kb (confidence: 0.9)
✅ **High confidence response** (0.89) - Information is well-sourced and reliable.
```

### **Emergency Detection**  
```
User: "I'm having severe chest pain and shortness of breath"

Bot: 🚨 **MEDICAL EMERGENCY** 🚨

If you're experiencing a medical emergency, please:
• Call emergency services immediately (911/999/112)  
• Go to the nearest emergency room
• Do not delay seeking professional medical help

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
• Call emergency services now (911/999/112)
• Do not delay seeking professional medical help  
• Follow emergency responder instructions
• Stay calm and seek immediate assistance
```

## 🔮 **Future Enhancements**

- 🌐 **External API Integration**: CDC, DrugBank, PubMed real-time data
- 🧠 **Advanced ML Models**: Specialized medical NLP models
- 📱 **Multi-Modal Support**: Image analysis for symptoms
